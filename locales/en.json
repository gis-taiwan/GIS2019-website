In the twentieth century, the population and productivity of Asians have surpassed half the entire world. Since the financial crisis in 2008, Western countries are no longer the superior ones; instead, the economic power has shifted from the west to east. Especially the recent trade war between China and the United States, it has caused an impact on Taiwan and the world’s political system. Severe weather change leading to urgent energy transitions; market saturation causing industry innovation and infrastructure; Artificial Intelligence bringing revolution to career choices and living styles.",

This year, we will bound from “The Great Wealth Transfer” to discuss the role for our generation and the changes we can make in the era when baby boomers start to fade. Facing their wealth, what the millennials want to do is changing the world instead of merely satisfying their material needs. With new techniques and technology, we will exert our power to break the rigid system and the stale regulations and to define the novel era on our own.

The decline of both rates nowadays gives rise to the occurrence of aging society and the tendency to have fewer children, which lead to great impacts on the society, economy and moral standards. This year, GIS Taiwan will place emphasis on ”smart health” and ”long-term care” with an eye to exploring the revolutionary innovation brought by the combination of technology and medicine as well as its future potential. What kinds of technological applications or social mechanism we can expect to assist us when we age?

This year, GIS Taiwan will launch the discussion of the interaction between man and land.
